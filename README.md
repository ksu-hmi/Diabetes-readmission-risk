# Risk-Calculation for readmissions for Diabetics
This project will help determine the readmission risk for diabetic patients. Specifically on insulin vs oral medication dependent diabetics. We will determine if members who use insulin or oral diabetic medicaitons, metformin, are more prone to readmission. 
We will calculate a readmission risk number based on their medications, clinical indicators and social determinents of health. This risk number will help clinicians determine if the patient is at a higher risk for readmission. For example, a score of 75 would indicate a 75% chance of readmission. This will help organizations set thresholds internally on what they find as acceptable levels of risk for readmission and these would guide the discharge decisions.

Example:
75-100 - Very high probability for readmission
50-74.9 - High probability for readmission
25-49.9 - Moderate probability for readmisssion
0-24.9 - Low probability for readmission


The code may not always be functional.

# Purpose
The purpose of this is to better the discharge planning of patient's who have diabetes. If a member has a high readmission risk, the patient's medical team can incorporate other healthcare members into their care, such as case managers, their insurance company, and even family members who are willing to help.
