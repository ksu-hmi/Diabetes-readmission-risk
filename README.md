# Discharge-Planning & Risk-Calucation-App
This project will be an app to help with followup appointments after a discharge to decrease re-admission rates. In addition to helping schedule and track follow up appointments, the app will calculate a readmission risk number based on clinical indicators and social determinents of health. This risk number would help clinicians determine if the patient is ready for discharge. For example, a score of 75 would indicate a 75% chance of readmission. The organization utlizing the app would set thresholds internally on what they find as acceptable levels of risk for readmission and these would guide the discharge decisions.

Example:
75-100 - Very high probability for readmission
50-74.9 - High probability for readmission
25-49.9 - Moderate probability for readmisssion
0-24.9 - Low probability for readmission

The code may not always be functional.
